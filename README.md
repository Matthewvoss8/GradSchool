Lyme Disease project

The purpose of this project is to better model the data than the researchers who used Logistic Regression. To learn more about their prior work go here:

In order to better understand the data, we want to find the most accurate model via a few metrics such as accuracy, examine a confusion matrix and AUC. 
Next, we would like to choose between the top two models with some sort of model selection process. We think this pursuit is useful, because we can better
understand what features are especially important in effecting the spread of Lyme Disease. We have a few features that are applicable beyond our dataset 
and would be helpful to other entomologist trying to study the spread of Lyme Disease.
