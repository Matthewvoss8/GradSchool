# Ticks in the Midwest
By Cassidy Kohls and Matthew Voss

The purpose of this project is to build a better model than the orignal researchers, who used both Logistic Regression and Cox Regression. To learn more about their prior work, visit: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.2278. In order to better understand the data, we want to find the most accurate model via a few metrics such as accuracy. Next, we would like to choose between the top two models with some sort of model selection process. We think this pursuit is helpful because we can better understand what features are especially important in affecting the spread of Lyme Disease. We have a few features that are applicable beyond our dataset and would be helpful to other entomologists trying to study the spread of Lyme Disease.
